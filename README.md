# nav-side-drawer

This project is dedicated to a global react-aphrodite navigation sidebar with a drawer and its basic functionalities, which are:

* A main burger menu icon which opens the drawer
* A drawer animation when opening
* A main title next to the burger menu icon
* Four different changeable icons with respective four different changeable labels
* An selected style when the drawer is closed
* An hover style when the drawer is opened
* Closing fuctions in the drawer header and when clicking in one of four options

The code was done with react and aphrodite but can be pretty easy changed to fit every kind of react project.
